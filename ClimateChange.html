            <h3> Is It Real? </h3> <!-- the heading for my first section of information about how climate change is real and it is serious -->
                <p> The warming of the atmosphere nowadays is the result of human activities. The biggest reason why humans are responsible for climate change is because of the increase in our Carbon Dioxide (CO <sub> 2 </sub>) emissions. Since humans are causing this we are the ones that can stop the majority of global warming. </p>
            
            <h3> How To Stop It </h3> <!-- a list of ways we can help reduce climate change -->
                <ul> 
                    <li> Use cleaner, renewable energy methods like solar and wind energy </li>
                    <li> reduce our transportation emmissions (ex: car-share, bikes) </li>
                    <li> Recycle, plant trees, AND MORE </li>
                </ul>

                <p> What some of you can do in order to reduce your contribution to global warming is trying to use mass transportation more, like buses and trains, in order to reduce how much CO <sub> 2 </sub> that is emitted into the atmosphere. Others ways that you can help is to use more environmentally friendly items like solar panels that absorb the sun's UV rays instead of burning oil to heat up your house or even something very small like reusing a metal straw can help cut back on plastics that are entering into our oceans and killing the aquatic life. </p> <!-- a paragraph about what we can do to help slow down climate change -->
                    <br />
                <p> Some fundraisers and charities that you could contribute to help, not directly with climate change, but factors that are also affecting the environment like <a href = "https://solar-aid.org/gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqImJpPOf4gIVFIezCh2WxA82EAAYAiAAEgKLn_D_BwE" target = "_blank"> SolarAid </a> that helps to combat poverty and climate change or <a href = "https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/fundraising-for-climate-change" target = "_blank"> Inside Philanthropy </a> have fundraisers and funders that help educate those so that they understand more about climate change and how it truly is affecting the environment. </p> <!-- some websites and fundraisers to help benefit and bring awareness to global warming -->
